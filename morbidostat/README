Scripts to enable morbidostat on eVOLVER2.0 from FynchBio

2021-10-23 eVOLVER.py change logs
- added the ability to change power levels
- edited so that the only vials to save data from are the active vials in the experiment
- added the ability to accept and interpreet linear_od and exp calibration files for OD
- added the ability to reject the active calibration from eVOLVER
- added directories and files to store PID controller files (growth_rate, drug_log, PID_log, offset_log)
- changed socketIO.wait(seconds = x), from x to 0.1 to 0.5 to allow for longer scripts to still pass on dilution messages

2021-10-23 custom_script.py change logs
- added initial power levels
- added additional operational mode for morbidostat
- added GLOBAL_VIALS parameter to set active vials
