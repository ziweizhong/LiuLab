Scripts to enable morbidostat on eVOLVER2.0 from FynchBio
To enable morbidostat mode and to ensure that dilution commands are run because of the complexity in custom_script.py, 
the timeout value in the conf.yml file (pi@<ip address>:~/evolver/evolver/conf.yml) needs to be increased to 0.8. 
Might be acceptable with lower timeout, but 0.3 is not enough.


eVOLVER.py change log
2021-11-19
- moved all user-defined variables to config.yml
- added snapshots of config.yml and custom_script.py, but only updates when changes are detected via md5 checksum

2021-11-02
- added automatic rejection of new calibrations if the elapsed time is greater than 1 hr
- changed the terminal to show the name of the experiment, instead of the generic eVOLVER experiment

2021-10-24
- added confirmed_pump_log.txt file upon new experiment

2021-10-23
- added the ability to change power levels
- edited so that the only vials to save data from are the active vials in the experiment
- added the ability to accept and interpreet linear_od and exp calibration files for OD
- added the ability to reject the active calibration from eVOLVER
- added directories and files to store PID controller files (growth_rate, drug_log, PID_log, offset_log)
- changed socketIO.wait(seconds = x), from x to 0.1 to 0.5 to allow for longer scripts to still pass on dilution messages

custom_script.py change log
2021-11-19
- moved all user-defined variables to config.yml

2021-10-24
- create a check for if pumps were run, and resends the message if they were not

2021-10-23
- added initial power levels
- added additional operational mode for morbidostat
- added GLOBAL_VIALS parameter to set active vials
