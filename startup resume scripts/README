This folder contains the files that were used to enable the ability to resume eVOLVER experiments upon an unexpected shutdown or restart (such as app update or power loss)
You will need to ensure that startup.sh is run on startup, either via adding it to ~/.config/autostart/autostart.desktop, crontab, or some other method

Additionally, eVOLVER experiments should be called not by running "python eVOLVER.py", but rather using the accessory files run_ev1/2.sh, which will output the cwd to a file which will persist if the eVOLVER.py script is not terminated by the user or a completion point
