Files for calibration of eVOLVER

calibration.py has been updated to enable new fitting methods

calibration-stacked.py and stackplot.py are very crude scripts to enable plot overlays from multiple calibration experiments

eVOLVER.py and custom_script.py are meant to be run together to enable electron-GUI-less generation of raw OD calibration data
  - PLEASE NOTE: for this script, it will ask you to save data. ONLY SAVE THE DATA WHEN YOU SEE IT APPEAR AFTER A DELAY.
  - This is due to the stacking mechanism of eVOLVER broadcasts every 20 seconds, thus to ensure that the data is refreshed and reflects the correct vials.
  - Also note that the script has output bugs, but note that 16 points need to be saved.
  - This script is for OD data only and does not take replicate values. 
  - Currently, there is no plan to implement temperature calibration, as these values are generally stable and use of the electron-GUI once for generation is not overly burdensome
  
gen_json.py generates the od_cal.json file after generation of raw calibration data from eVOLVER.py and custom_script.py
  - raw OD file and measured OD values will have to be manually entered into the code

Power sweep contains the eVOLVER.py and custom_script.py file that allows the generation of Detector values vs LED power for all vials
  - please note that the output file has incorrect naming of power values, they need to be offset by 4 (e.g. row 12 has the power level stated in row 8)
    - This bug will hopefully be fixed in a later release
