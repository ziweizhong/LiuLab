Code for running the eVOLVER 1.0 with Python, and is only compatible with Python 2.7

To run eVOLVER scripts, python files can be saved anywhere and does not have to be in current working directory. However, current directory should be where config.yml, od_cal.txt, and temperature_cal.txt should be located. 
Experiments will be saved with the given name in the config.yml file in the current working directory.
Enables running multiple experiments on the same machine with one version of the master code
